      <h3>Cinematography</h3>
      <p>
        Cinematography (from ancient Greek κίνημα, kìnema "movement" and
        γράφειν, gràphein "to write") is the art of motion picture (and more
        recently, electronic video camera) photography. Cinematographers use a
        lens to focus reflected light from objects into a real image that is
        transferred to some image sensor or light-sensitive material inside a
        movie camera.
